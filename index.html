                    In the beginning, there was GoDaddy...and it was good. No, actually it was just fine. After they raised
                    my monthly costs for the third time, I was thoroughly annoyed. When I had to jump through hoops and pay them
                    more for basic things that should be free - like SSL certs and SMTP email service - I really started to get
                    mad. I'd also purchased some domains in the early 2000s with NTC Hosting, though; and, since that required me
                    to install PHP manually and felt about as trustworthy as buying a wristwatch from a shady back-alley dealer
                    in a trenchcoat, I tolerated GoDaddy for a fair time.

                    When I began study at the (then) Code Louisville coding bootcamp, I learned all about git and GitHub and started
                    to host some projects with GitHub Pages. Pairing that with custom domains from Namecheap or similar domain brokers
                    is very easy to setup and low maintenance. The big downside is that GitHub Pages is only for static sites, so there's
                    no easy way to add a server side or database. Pretty perfect for JAMstack sites, though - especially once I abandoned
                    Namecheap, Google Domains, etc. for Cloudflare. SSL certs, CDN, DNS management, security, logging, and so much more,
                    all for an extremely reasonable price (free, for most of my small sites). Nowadays, Cloudflare has become an even
                    better solution, with the advent and expansion of Cloudflare Pages and Workers. If I needed a backend, I'd pick up
                    a DigitalOcean droplet or Linode (now Akamai) instance.

                    Once I started working at Kentucky Education Television (KET), I entered
                    the wonderful world of Amazon Web Services (AWS). In that paradise of intuitive, well-named, streamlined features
                    (sarcasm, in case you don't know about AWS), I discovered a fairly cheap option for hosting and domain management.
                    The big strength of AWS, is integrating custom domains (Route 53) with hosting (EC2/ECS), a CDN (CloudFront),
                    serverless functions (Lambda), and a flood of other confusingly named services for every need under the sun.
                    The downsides of AWS are plentiful and well known: granular control of C-Names and DNS records is great...as long
                    as you know what those are and when/how to edit their values. Fortunately for me, that was my job for a while, so
                    that's not an issue; fluency in the CLI makes it even easier. The pricing model is a nightmare, though, and
                    it's easy to accidentally rack up huge bills, even if you're careful. After crunching the numbers, I found AWS
                    to be an excellent option for just about every service...except hosting. BRUTAL.

                    So, here I am with too many logins and too many services (with the bills to match) and a decision to make about
                    where to host my blog. So I did a bunch of research, and really reconsidered my footprint with an aim to consolidate.
                    And, you know what I decided to do differently? Basically nothing. I was between "chado.dev/blog" and "blog.chado.dev".
                    Since this domain is on Namecheap and I didn't want the hassle of having to remember/reset my login, I ended up
                    just deploying to GitHub Pages and naming the repo "blog" - the default URL is exactly what I wanted!
