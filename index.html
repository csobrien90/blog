                    I recently acquired a new toy: a Roland JD-Xi. It's a compact, 36-key synthesizer with just under
                    a billion knobs, buttons, sliders, and switchers.

                    I'm super excited (and more than a little intimidated)
                    to start creating music with this instrument &mdash; it has a drum sampler, a lot of memory to store preset
                    tones and loops, a vocoder, and a whole slew of other features I don't even know about yet! I'm not exactly
                    starting from scratch musically, but I am going to need a lot of help learning this equipment.
                </p>
                <p>Enter ChatGPT, STAGE RIGHT</p>
                <p>
                    There are a ton of videos on YouTube that I will watch throughout the learning process, but for a quick
                    back and forth, an LLM chat bot that has consumed the manual and a bunch of online tutorials should make a
                    great reference. SO I pulled up a new chat and dipped my toes in the water:
                </p>
<pre>
Me:
    I just got a Roland Juno xi and need help getting some things going. Have you read the manual?

ChatGPT:
    Nice ‚Äî congrats, the JUNO-Xi is a really capable little workstation! üéπ
    Yes, I'm familiar with the Roland JUNO-Xi Owner's Manual and the Parameter Guide
    (the two main documents Roland provides). I know the general structure ‚Äî patch editing,
    performance/multitimbral setup, pattern sequencer, USB audio/MIDI functions, and system settings.

    Before diving in ‚Äî can you tell me what you want to get going first? For example:

    * üîå Connecting it to your computer or DAW (USB audio/MIDI, drivers, etc.)
    * üéõÔ∏è Editing tones/patches or making custom sounds
    * üé∂ Using the sequencer or rhythm pattern functions
    * üé§ Setting up the mic/vocoder
    * üéß Using it as an audio interface
    * üéöÔ∏è Layering/splitting sounds in Performance mode

    Once I know your goals, I can point you to the exact sections of the manual and give
    step-by-step help. What are you trying to do first?
</pre>
                <p>
                    First of all, remember when
                    <a
                        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/technology/chatgpt-alexa-please-thank-you.html"
                        target="_blank"
                    >Sam Altman said we should stop saying "please" and "thank you" to AI</a>
                    because it wastes compute? I do...but, with an answer like that for a simple yes or no question,
                    I'm not sure the prompts are the problem...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, in hindsight, this should have raised a red flag. There's actually no such thing as a "Juno xi".
                    It's actually called a "JD-Xi", putting it in the "Juno-D" product line. As we went on, it became clear
                    that ChatGPT had not caught that and, instead, assumed I was asking about a different model, the "Juno-X".
                    It seemed to understand my questions and answered with confidence, but it's answers referenced buttons and
                    options that didn't exist. I told it as much:
                </p>
<pre>
Me:
    I don't have any of those buttons‚Ä¶no performance button and no rhythm pattern button. I switch Part Select
    to Drums and use the pattern sampler to make a beat.

ChatGPT:
    Ahh ‚Äî got it, thank you for clarifying ‚Äî you've got the JUNO-Di/Xi (the compact one with the small screen and
    limited buttons), not the bigger JUNO-X. That changes everything about how you access drums vs. keys.

    Let's reset expectations and walk through what's actually happening on your JUNO-Xi.
</pre>
                <p>
                    Notice any issues? Well, there's no such thing as a Juno-Di/Xi - that's two different models. Then, it still refers
                    to my model as "Juno-Xi". It went on to give me very detailed instructions, starting with "Step 1: Enter Performance
                    Mode - Press [MENU] ‚Üí Performance Edit (or just hold SHIFT and press PERFORM if your model has that shortcut)." Only
                    one problem...
                </p>
<pre>
Me:
    My menu doesn't have performance edit either - it's got program edit, tone edit, effects edit, vocoder edit, auto
    pitch edit, arpeggio edit, chord edit, pattern length, scale setting, utility and version of

ChatGPT:
    Ahh ‚Äî perfect clarification. You're not on the JUNO-Xi (with the larger screen) or the JUNO-Di workstation.
    You've actually got the Roland JUNO-&lt;PRIVATE_PERSON&gt;** ‚Äî specifically the JUNO-Gi, right? Or maybe the JUNO-G?
    Can you confirm the full model name printed above the screen or pitch bend lever?
</pre>
                <p>
                    Lord knows what sort of glitch "&lt;PRIVATE_PERSON&gt;" is &mdash; that had me rolling! Tired of the back and
                    forth, I finally got out my synth and looked at the exact model number. Once I told ChatGPT I was using the
                    "JD-Xi", we were off to the races:
                </p>
<pre>
ChatGPT:
    Ahhh ‚Äî that explains everything. üî•

    You've got the Roland JD-Xi, the tiny red-and-black synth with the mini keys ‚Äî not the JUNO-Xi.
    That's a totally different beast under the hood. The JD-Xi is a mini workstation with 4 parts (drums + 2 digital
    synths + 1 analog synth), a step sequencer, and pattern-based looping ‚Äî no ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù button because every
    pattern already is a performance.

    So, here's exactly how to do what you're trying to do:
    (...)
</pre>
                <p>
                    After a rocky start, we were now aligned and it provided the exact help I needed! Of course, from now on, I
                    can just use this same context to ask more questions about the JD-Xi without having to re-explain everything.
                    That said, that was an annoying start to the process and it didn't inspire confidence in future interactions.
                    This is a primary use case for AI agents (that could, for instance, go fetch the actual manual PDF) and, if I
                    end up using this more regularly, I may have to explore that route.

                    In the beginning, there was GoDaddy...and it was good. No, actually it was just fine. After they raised
                    my monthly costs for the third time, I was thoroughly annoyed. When I had to jump through hoops and pay them
                    more for basic things that should be free - like SSL certs and SMTP email service - I really started to get
                    mad. I'd also purchased some domains in the early 2000s with NTC Hosting, though; and, since that required me
                    to install PHP manually and felt about as trustworthy as buying a wristwatch from a shady back-alley dealer
                    in a trenchcoat, I tolerated GoDaddy for a fair time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I began study at the (then) Code Louisville coding bootcamp, I learned all about git and GitHub and started
                    to host some projects with GitHub Pages. Pairing that with custom domains from Namecheap or similar domain brokers
                    is very easy to setup and low maintenance. The big downside is that GitHub Pages is only for static sites, so there's
                    no easy way to add a server side or database. Pretty perfect for JAMstack sites, though - especially once I abandoned
                    Namecheap, Google Domains, etc. for Cloudflare. SSL certs, CDN, DNS management, security, logging, and so much more,
                    all for an extremely reasonable price (free, for most of my small sites). Nowadays, Cloudflare has become an even
                    better solution, with the advent and expansion of Cloudflare Pages and Workers. If I needed a backend, I'd pick up
                    a DigitalOcean droplet or Linode (now Akamai) instance.

                    Once I started working at Kentucky Education Television (KET), I entered
                    the wonderful world of Amazon Web Services (AWS). In that paradise of intuitive, well-named, streamlined features
                    (sarcasm, in case you don't know about AWS), I discovered a fairly cheap option for hosting and domain management.
                    The big strength of AWS, is integrating custom domains (Route 53) with hosting (EC2/ECS), a CDN (CloudFront),
                    serverless functions (Lambda), and a flood of other confusingly named services for every need under the sun.
                    The downsides of AWS are plentiful and well known: granular control of C-Names and DNS records is great...as long
                    as you know what those are and when/how to edit their values. Fortunately for me, that was my job for a while, so
                    that's not an issue; fluency in the CLI makes it even easier. The pricing model is a nightmare, though, and
                    it's easy to accidentally rack up huge bills, even if you're careful. After crunching the numbers, I found AWS
                    to be an excellent option for just about every service...except hosting. BRUTAL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, here I am with too many logins and too many services (with the bills to match) and a decision to make about
                    where to host my blog. So I did a bunch of research, and really reconsidered my footprint with an aim to consolidate.
                    And, you know what I decided to do differently? Basically nothing. I was between "chado.dev/blog" and "blog.chado.dev".
                    Since this domain is on Namecheap and I didn't want the hassle of having to remember/reset my login, I ended up
                    just deploying to GitHub Pages and naming the repo "blog" - the default URL is exactly what I wanted!
